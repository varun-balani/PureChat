# FAQ
**Why can't players have coloured chat?**

You need to set 'pchat.coloredMessages' permission for the players if you want to allow them to use colored messages

**What are the colour codes to use, and where should I put them?**

See the available colour codes listed in the Config. Do not use colour codes in PurePerms groups directly, use PureChat config instead.
